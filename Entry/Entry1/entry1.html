  <h1>A perfume collection website</h1>
  <h2>I will share one of my favorite perfumes on the site each week. The homepage of the website has a variety of pictures of perfumes. And you can click on each one to see a description of the perfume. And I'll make corresponding visual design through the style of perfume to show on the website.
  </h2>
  <h2> I collected a lot of perfume and I think it is meaningful to share my favorite perfume recommendations with you. And I think it's an interesting idea to use visual design to showcase a perfume.</h2>
  <h2>I will make some web interactive games related to perfumes. To make the audience feel involved. And make the site more interesting.</h2>
